## The Challenge

For this exercise, you will consume GitHub issues to create a simple interface that will
aid a product manager in prioritizing issues and/or enhancements for a given repository.

There's no need to worry about logging in via GitHub at this point: when a user hits the site, they should submit an appropriate GitHub API key. Once the API key is submitted, send them to the prioritization interface.

When a user first loads the application, they should be able to choose a given repository that they have access to. Once selecting this repository, the screen should change from a single column interface to a two column interface. The left side depicting a list of repositories the user has access to and the right being the encapsulated issues of the given repository. (Donâ€™t worry about pagination. Keep it simple.)

The default rank of the issues should be what the API supports by default: created, desc. Once the issues load a user should be able to re-order the issues in whatever priority suits the current need for that sprint. The customized order should be able to be persisted in a current client-side session so that if you refresh the page, the order will remain.

### Prerequisites

This code runs on Google Chrome. You will need a [Github Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to interface with this app.

### Installing

After cloning the repo, simply run:

```bash
npm install
```

in the root, then:

```bash
npm start
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) and [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/). To run the automated tests, run:

```bash
npm run test
```

in the root.
